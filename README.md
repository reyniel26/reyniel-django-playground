# reyniel-django-playground
My Django playground. The place where I can do want ever I want, I can test what ever I want, just to learn Django.

## Installation

2. Create a virtual environment by running `v`
3. Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.
    - **Note:** Make sure you are running in virtual environment
